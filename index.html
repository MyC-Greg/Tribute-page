        <h3>Short biography</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Albert Camus was a French-Algerian journalist, playwright, novelist, philosophical essayist, and Nobel laureate.</li>
          <li>He is mostly know for his literary work: his three most famous novels:
              <ul>
            <li>The Stranger,</li>
            <li>The Plague,</li>
            <li>and The Fall</li></ul>
           and two book-length philosophical essays:
            <ul> <li>The Myth of Sisyphus,</li>
               <li>and The Rebel,</li></ul>
            that granted him international reputation and readership.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>He developed a phylosophy based on two main concepts:</li>
          <ul> <li>the Absurd</li>
             <li>and The Revolt that refers to both a path of resolved action and a state of mind.</li></ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>His political views established him as an outspoken champion of individual freedom and as an impassioned critic of tyranny and terrorism, whether practiced by the Left or by the Right.</li>
          <li>He himself took action in the French Resistance against Nazism during the second World War.</li>
        </ul>


          <ul>
                  He concluded his Nobel acceptance speech with this stirring reminder that can extend to every citizen:
                  “The nobility of our craft,” he declared, “will always be rooted in two commitments, both difficult to maintain: the refusal to lie about what one knows and the resistance to oppression.”
          </ul>
